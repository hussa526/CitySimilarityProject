# CitySimilarityProject

The goal of this project was to collect demographic data on 60 North American cities and visualize how similar they are to each other in the form of a graph (nodes and edges). In order to create this I taught myself networkx to visualize my data. 

course_project_4 - full analysis and report on my findings 

personal_prject.py - reading my csv file and giving a score for each demographic variable

citydataset.csv - a csv file made by myself with data from the Canadian and US census bureau

main - running the program

create_graph - creating my graph from the scores generated in personal_prject.py
